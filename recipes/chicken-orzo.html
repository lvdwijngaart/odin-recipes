                Chicken and Lemon Orzo is a quick and easy dish that can be prepared in one pan, 
                making everything from the cooking to the cleaning to be fast and efficient. But make no mistake, 
                while quick and easy, it contains rich flavours that work together amazingly. The lemon really is 
                the cherry on top of this dish.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups of uncooked orzo</li>
                <li>2-3 cups of water</li>
                <li>1 bouillon tablet</li>
                <li>350 grams of (vegeterian) chicken</li>
                <li>1/2 lemon</li>
                <li>1 big onion</li>
                <li>1 zucchini</li>
                <li>200 grams of white cheese</li>
                <li>150 grams of mozzarella</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>As preparation, dice the onions and grate the zucchini. Also cut the chicken in semi-small pieces. </li>
                <li>First cook the Chicken for 3-5 minutes until they're crispy. </li>
                <li>Take the cooked chicken from the pan and put in the diced onions and cook until they start to discolour. </li>
                <li>Add the uncooked orzo to the pan and toast for 5 minutes, but don't let them burn. </li>
                <li>Then add the zucchini and add the bouillon tablet mixed with the water. Let this simmer with a lid until most of the water has been absorbed. </li>
                <li>Grate some of the skin of half a lemon over the dish and also squeeze the juice of the lemon in the orzo. </li>
                <li>Finally add the cooked chicken and the white cheese and mozzarella to the pan and let simmer for 2 more minutes so the cheese melts in between the orzo. Then it's bon-appetit! </li>
            </ol>
